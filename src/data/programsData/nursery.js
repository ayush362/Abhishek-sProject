      *As per RTE- Right to Education and NEP- National Education Policy from state to state.

      The child is now identified as a Pre-schooler. (Mandatory level 1 of Foundational Stage as per NEP) To set a firm foundation in the early years of preschool, quality education is vital for the overall development of a child. Our nursery education has a right array of activities that helps a child move towards achieving their early learning goals.

      Quality education in the early years of preschool lays a strong foundation for the overall development of a child. The nursery curriculum engages children in FLN- (Foundation in literacy and Numeracy) school readiness activities such as reading, writing, counting, number value, and problem-solving in a fun-filled but purposeful manner. Children are encouraged to display their learning through collaborative activities in the areas of dramatics, science, and arts.
